# ServerAllocation
The program deals with assigning servers to a job based. The allocation is done randomly according to the server size. To load balance jobs across the servers, each job is assigned to a random server such that if server X is three times as big as server Y, then server X gets assigned three times as often as server Y. So server X would be assigned approximately 75% of the time and server Y would be assigned 25% of the time. The program takes server names and sizes as arguments and outputs the name of a random server based on the algorithm described above.
